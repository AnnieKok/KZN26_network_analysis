<h1> Annie Kok PhD Research <br>
Dark Networks: A South African Cash-in-Transit Crime Case Study</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This repository contains the code developed for my PhD research on the KZN26 CIT criminal network in South Africa. The code is structured to facilitate the analysis of network dynamics at multiple levels, including network, community, and node levels. The analysis was conducted to explore patterns of connection and cohesion within the network. Additionally, disruption scenarios were simulated using social capital strategies to assess their impact on network stability and resilience.

Due to ethical considerations, the data used in this research cannot be publicly shared. Researchers interested in accessing the data or collaborating on similar projects are encouraged to contact me directly.

<h2>Usage</h2>

File Ch5_KZN26_Data_Curation.R cleans and wrangles the data. File CH5_KZN26_SNA.R executes the network analysis and creates all the plots. The scripts cannot execute without the required data files. However, researchers with access to similar datasets can adapt the code accordingly.
